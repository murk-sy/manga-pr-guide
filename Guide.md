> ☣️ **Tread lightly:** This guide still needs a through proofread itself.


# 🛂 Introduction

So you've read some manga and thought "Hey, I want to help with that!" and decided that proofreading sounds like something you'd like to do. That's great!

This guide covers the scanlation process from Japanese to English, so some information is specific to that. At the time of writing this guide, I've only been proofreading for a few weeks, so don't take this document as a holy commandment.

Don't let the length discourage you - skim through and once you find something you're unsure about, it's time to read in more detail.


# 💮 The scanlation process

As a proofreader, you're just a piece of the puzzle in the entire process. The people involved are the following:

1. **Raw Provider** obtains a copy of the printed manga and scans it into so called "raws".
2. **Translator (TL)** translates the original text.
3. **Proofreader (PR)** corrects the translated text.
4. **Cleaner (CL)** removes original dialogue and overall cleans the page (remove noise from scanning, align the page, etc).
5. **Redrawer (RD)** redraws parts of the page that were originally covered up by Japanese text.
6. **Typesetter (TS)** takes the proofread text and inserts it into the pages, picking context appropriate font styles in the process.
7. **Quality checker (QC)** does the final check and generally also uploads the completed scanlation.

The actual order the process takes place in may depend on the group and project, but generally cleaners can start at the same time as translators. In addition, a single person can take care of multiple steps on the process, though this once again depends on the group.



# 🕵️ Proofreading

**As a proofreader, your most basic task is taking translated text and making sure it sounds natural.** This does not always mean just fixing grammatical mistakes and changing awkward word order - sometimes you'll have to completely rewrite the entire speech bubble to make it sound natural. How difficult your job actually ends up being depends mostly on the skill and experience of the translator. That can extend a relatively simple proofreading task into a much more in depth editing assignment.

When proofreading, you should do multiple passes of the script, preferably in separate sittings. For daily manga, you might be on a tight schedule, but for longer projects it's best to, at *the very least*, do the final pass on a different day.

The workflow I generally use consists of multiple start-to-end read-throughs of the entire script:

0. Transcribing the translations into a document (if not already), listing untranslated sound effects
1. Proofreading and rough editing of anything that immediately sticks out or sounds weird
2. Editing and marking any lines that need translator feedback
3. Contact translator to get further context
4. Editing based on translator feedback
5. Final read-through

This is a rough outline - I generally do at least 4 passes, though that can depend wildly on the size of the project and translation quality. Usually I make minor changes during the final read-through as well.

Regardless of the quality of the translation, **you** are ultimately responsible for what gets put on the proverbial paper. Errors and inconsistencies arising from inaccurate translations are something you need to keep an eye out. If one speech bubble seems out of place or contradicts the rest of the dialogue, it's time to consult the translator.


## 🔎 Proofreading basics

At its core, proofreading consists of the following:

- Fixing spelling errors
- Fixing grammatical mistakes
- Fixing quotation marks, apostrophes

If you're a native English speaker or a fluent non-native speaker, spotting and fixing most of these should come natural. Regardless of that, even native speakers make common mistakes, such as misusing "they're" (contractive) and "their" (possessive) or writing "should of" (which is **never** correct) instead of "should have". While misspellings and most of the glaring grammatical errors can be found fairly reliably with a software solution, you should not rely on that.

Sound effects (SFX) or any particularly emotional speech may be translated fairly awkwardly with a lot of punctuation or letter repetiton, and it is your job to make them more sensible. Some examples:

* Huuuuuuuuh????
* Aaauuuuuugggggggghhhhh!
* WHY ARE WE STILL HERE??!!!
* BOOOOOOOOOM!!!
* That's terrible......

It's easy to get carried away with punctuation to make a point, but you need to remember: what you're trying to do is something typesetters do by using different fonts, font sizes and word shapes. You don't convey a massive explosion by writing "BOOOOOOOOOM!!!!!" in Times New Roman, you do it by writing "BOOOM!" in a font with a rough look - with a good font, you don't even need punctuation.

Using punctuation sparingly makes the finished text look more professional, which is ultimately the goal. You should stick to the following:

`!`, `!!`, `?`, `??`, `!??`, `?!!`, `??`, `.`, `...`

For repeating letters within words, I have my own guideline I call "Rule of squares", and it's basically "don't repeat any single letter more than twice as many times as the previous (or next) letter". The above example already breaks that rule, but for words with effectively 3 different letters, having 3 of the middle one is not too extreme. The rule also breaks down if there's letters you can't voice individually - if you try to voice "Augh" and try to stretch every single letter (like "aaaaaauuuuuugggggghhhhhh"), you'll see that you can't stop on "G". It's the same with P, T, K, B, D and G.

Although exact correction would be context sensitive as well, here are some more sensible alternatives to the above:

* Huuh??
* Auuuughh!
* WHY ARE WE STILL HERE!??
* BOOOM!!
* That's terrible...


## 🔬 Editing basics

(TODO WIP)

> "The whole is more than the sum of its parts."


(TODO REWRITE) Understanding what you're reading is an extremely important. If you don't know a word that's used, look it up - even most search engines can provide fairly exhaustive definitions including synonyms by just searching "define exhaustive". Because word-for-word translations rarely work, sometimes the words used sound right and are technically correct, but context wise end up being completely tone-deaf. "Kicked the bucket" is an example of a 

(TODO example: official subs vs fansubs)


## ⛩️ Lost in translation

With eastern and western cultures being vastly different, it won't take long to hit the first snag.

# 🗾 "Reading" Japanese

> ⚠️ **Important:** You do not *need* to read and understand this section to start proofreading. **This section is extremely simplified and some terms may be misnamed to get basic concepts across, based on my own understanding.** Some of these will help you understand how and why some text is written the way it is. *You don't need to memorize symbols or anything like that.* Additionally, this is **not** a basis for learning Japanese by any stretch of the imagination. Sources for this information are mostly listed in the [Sources](Sources.md) file. 

## 💬 Direction

East Asian scripts (Chinese, Japanese and Korean) have a common feature of being able to be written either top to bottom, left to right, right to left or even bottom to top. The last one is rare, but having text written in reverse on one side of a truck (so it's front to back on both sides) might be something you run into.

Due to what can be summarized mostly as western influence, Japanese text in things like math textbooks and on computer screens is generally read left to right in multiple rows of text, top to bottom - basically how English works.

Text in manga or literature, however, is read the traditional way: top to bottom in multiple *columns* of text, right to left. Because of this, manga is also read back to front (pages), right to left (panels), top to bottom (text). 

Note that manga drawn in the style of 4-koma (4 panel top to bottom and usually self-contained manga) is sometimes drawn as 2 columns per page, in which case they must be read the same as text: panels top to bottom, and then columns of panels right to left.

## 😨 Japanese writing system

There are 3 different scripts used in Japanese (collectively called **Kana**):
* Hiragana
* Katakana
* Kanji

In addition to that, there's:
* Rōmaji - basically the latin alphabet
* Arabic numerals - used in horizontal text (kanji also has a numeric system)


### 🈁 Hiragana and Katakana

Hiragana (i.e. ひらがな) and katakana (i.e. カタカナ) are similar scripts where each symbol basically corresponds to a syllable. There's 46 (ish) of each. The table below contains most of both hiragana (first) and katakana (second).

|   | /     | k          | s     | t          | n          | h     | m     | y     | r     | w      |
|---|-------|------------|-------|------------|------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------|
| a | あ ア | **か**  カ | さ サ  | **た**  タ | **な**  ナ | は ハ | ま マ | や ヤ | ら ラ | わ  ワ |
| i | い イ | き キ      | し シ  | ち チ      | に ニ      | ひ ヒ | み ミ |       | り リ | ゐ ヰ  |
| u | う ウ | く ク      | す ス  | つ ツ      | ぬ ヌ      | ふ フ | む ム | ゆ ユ | る ル |        |
| e | え エ | け ケ      | せ セ  | て テ      | ね ネ      | へ ヘ | め メ |       | れ レ | ゑ ヱ  |
| o | お オ | こ コ      | そ ソ  | と ト      | の ノ      | ほ ホ | も モ | よ ヨ | ろ ロ | を     |
   
The first column are just sounds A, E, I, O, U, while further columns indicate sounds like KA, SI, TU, NE, etc. You may notice there's no letter L anywhere, which is one of the reasons Japanese people can't really pronounce words containing L without resorting to R.

For example, if you take the word かたかな and find it in the table (they're bolded), you will find that it spells KA-TA-KA-NA. If you do the same for カタカナ, you will find that the end result is exactly the same.

Hiragana is generally used for native words, while Katakana is used much more broadly. Borrowed words such as コーヒー (*koffie*, meaning coffee), onomatopoeia (sound effects), and also any words where the actual meaning is not known or incomprehensible, all use Katakana.



### ㊙️ Kanji

Kanji (ie: 漢字) is a script based on Chinese Han characters, where each symbol represents a concept, basically either a noun or a verb. There are 2000 to 3000 kanji in everyday use, and there is no exact count of how many there are in total - over 50 thousand at the very least.

As an example, take 日本. Each symbol has multiple meanings:
* 日 - schedule, time, sunshine, day, date, sun
* 本 - book, volume, work, body of work, oeuvre, volume, book, playscript, script, base 

Both symbols together mean "origin of the sun", which should remind you of the phrase "Land of the rising sun".

You can think of kanji sort of like using emoji instead of a homonym word in order to distinguish the intent. Both sound the same, but have distinctly different meanings.
* She learned that a 🙇 is not always the best way to approach people.
* She learned that a 🏹 is not always the best way to approach people.

> 💡 An important note on kanji is that in addition of multiple meanings, each symbol has *at least* 2 different ways of reading them. As names are written in kanji, they often include a reading aid (see Furigana). In manga, this sometimes leads to situations where a character will misread someone's name or a sign, which means the proofreader has to deal with the fallout of conveying the misunderstanding to the reader.

#### 📛 Furigana

Because of the difficulty of reading less common kanji, there are often additional smaller characters written next to them (or above, in case of horizontal writing) called furigana. Despite the similar name, furigana is just the name of the reading aid and is not a separate script.

Furigana by itself provides only information on how to read the kanji - the actual meaning of the kanji is not conveyed. It can, however, be used to convey hidden meanings. For example, kanji 男（おとこ, meaning "man") might have furigana ヒーロー (meaning "hero").

Hiragana is most commonly used, though katakana or latin also make appearances.


## ❔ Punctuation and typographical symbols

To make writing easier (or reading harder), there are several symbols that affect the way you read kana symbols.

(TODO Repetition marks, phonetic marks, somehow explain voiced consonants, other common quotation marks)

Because repetition symbols used resemble quotation marks, different symbols are used for quotes:

* **「** Quotation marks for when you're quoting someone. **」**
* **『** Double quotation marks, for things like book titles **』**
