# Introduction

So you've read some manga and thought "Hey, I want to help with that!" and decided that proofreading sounds like something you'd like to do. That's great!

**As a proofreader, your most basic task is taking translated text and making sure it sounds natural.** This does not mean just fixing grammar mistakes and changing awkward word order - sometimes you will have to completely rewrite the entire speech bubble to make it sound natural. How difficult your job actually ends up being depends mostly on the skill and experience of the translator before you.

This guide covers the scanlation process from Japanese to English so some information is specific to that. At the time of writing this guide, I've only been proofreading for a few weeks, so don't take this document as a holy commandment.


# The scanlation process

As a proofreader, you're just a piece of the puzzle in the entire process. The people involved are the following:

1. **Raw Provider** obtains a copy of the printed manga and scans it into so called "raws".
2. **Translator (TL)** translates the original text.
3. **Proofreader (PR)** (that's you!) corrects the translated text.
4. **Cleaner (CL)** removes original dialogue and overall cleans the page (remove noise from scanning, align the page, etc).
5. **Redrawer (RD)** redraws parts of the page that were originally covered up by Japanese text.
6. **Typesetter (TS)** takes the proofread text and inserts it into the pages, picking context appropriate font styles in the process.
7. **Quality checker (QC)** does the final check and generally also uploads the completed scanlation.

The actual order the process takes place in may depend on the group and project, but generally cleaners can start at the same time as translators. In addition, a single person can take care of multiple steps on the process, though this once again depends on the group.
